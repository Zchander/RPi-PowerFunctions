RPi-PowerFunctions
==================

A project to send commands over IR to a LEGO PowerFunctions receiver using an Raspberry Pi, I2C and an ATtiny2313

The Eagle project files have been added (including the PCB designs), as are the XMLRPC server files.

I'll try to update/create READMEs for the sub folders in the near future. Unfortunately my documenting skills are a bit 'subzero'

For this project I would like to thank a few people, who I will list down here. Please note that the order is random!
- Jurriaan Pruis (https://github.com/jurriaan/) for his project which gave me the idea(s)
- Dick de Wit (www.dansendelichtjes.nl) who helped me refresh some of my electronics skills
- A few from www.avrfreaks.net, some I will mention explicit:
- - kk6gm for inspiring me to NOT use _delay_ms/_delay_us in my code, but to use interrupts
- - kartman for his tutorial on multitasking on the AVR environment
- - david.prentice for directing me into a bug I introduced myself during code cleanup
- - clawson for his inspiring and helpful comments overall

(If I forgot someone, please let me know so I can include you on the list)
